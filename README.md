The go build command is used to compile Go source files into executable binaries. Here's how you can use it:

```bash
go build [source_file(s)]
```

For example, if you have a Go file named example.go, you can compile it with the following command:

```bash
go build exploit.go
```
By default, the go build command will generate an executable file with the same name as your Go source file (without the .go extension). If you want to specify a different output name, you can use the -o flag:

```bash
go build -o lucas exploit.go
```

This will generate an executable named myprogram (or myprogram.exe on Windows).

Alternatively, if you want to compile and run your Go program without generating a separate executable, you can use the go run command:

```bash
go run exploit.go
```

The go run command compiles and runs the Go program without leaving an executable behind.

Remember that the go build command will only compile the current package. If your project consists of multiple packages, consider using go install or go run in the context of your project's structure.
